# Nodara Network Solana Contracts

> **Smart contracts powering the decentralized smartphone microservice network**

## Overview

Nodara Network transforms smartphones into a distributed microservice ecosystem through Solana smart contracts. These programs enable trustless coordination, payment settlement, and reputation management for mobile devices providing verifiable functions like location proofs, sensor data, RPC proxying, and compute tasks.

**Core Value Proposition**: Rent small, verifiable functions from nearby or global phones and pay per use in SOL/SPL tokens.

## Smart Contract Architecture

### Program Suite

```
Nodara Network Smart Contracts
â”œâ”€â”€ DeviceRegistry      # Device onboarding & capabilities
â”œâ”€â”€ RelayPool           # Task matching & coordination
â”œâ”€â”€ PaymentRouter       # Escrow & reward distribution  
â”œâ”€â”€ TrustScoreKeeper    # Reputation & scoring system
â”œâ”€â”€ ProofVerifier       # Response validation
â””â”€â”€ TaskOrchestrator    # Cross-program coordination
```

### High-Level Flow

```
1. Device registers capabilities â†’ DeviceRegistry
2. User creates task â†’ TaskOrchestrator
3. Payment locked in escrow â†’ PaymentRouter
4. Task matched to devices â†’ RelayPool
5. Device completes task â†’ submits proof
6. Proof verified â†’ ProofVerifier
7. Reputation updated â†’ TrustScoreKeeper
8. Payment released â†’ PaymentRouter
```

## Program Responsibilities

### **DeviceRegistry**
- Device onboarding and capability declarations
- Geographic region and service availability tracking
- Device status management (online/offline)
- Stake-based reputation bonding

### **RelayPool**
- Task creation and broadcasting
- Device discovery and matching algorithms
- Execution coordination and timeout management
- Multi-response aggregation

### **PaymentRouter**
- Escrow-based payment holding
- Conditional payment release mechanisms
- Multi-token support (SOL/SPL)
- Protocol fee collection and dispute handling

### **TrustScoreKeeper**
- Performance metrics tracking
- Dynamic reputation scoring
- Penalty system for bad actors
- Reward multipliers for top performers

### **ProofVerifier**
- Cryptographic signature validation
- Service-specific proof verification (location, sensor data, etc.)
- Multi-signature consensus mechanisms
- Future: Zero-knowledge proof support

### **TaskOrchestrator**
- Cross-program invocation coordination
- Complex workflow management
- Atomic transaction guarantees
- Event emission and state synchronization

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.70+
- Solana CLI 1.16+
- Anchor Framework 0.29+
- Node.js 18+

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone and setup
